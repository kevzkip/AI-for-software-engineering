### 1. Essay Questions

**Q1: Edge AI Advantages**  
Edge AI reduces latency by processing data locally on devices rather than sending it to the cloud, eliminating network delays. For privacy, sensitive data never leaves the device - only insights are shared. Autonomous drones exemplify this by making real-time obstacle avoidance decisions without cloud dependency, processing camera feeds onboard to maintain low latency (typically <50ms) while keeping flight paths private.

**Q2: Quantum vs Classical AI**  
Quantum AI leverages qubit superposition and entanglement to evaluate multiple solutions simultaneously, offering exponential speedups for combinatorial problems like molecular modeling. Classical AI relies on sequential processing suited for pattern recognition. Financial portfolio optimization demonstrates this difference - where classical neural networks take hours to evaluate 10,000 combinations, quantum annealers like D-Wave can solve in minutes. Healthcare and logistics will benefit most from quantum AI's ability to optimize complex systems.

**Q3: Human-AI Healthcare Collaboration**  
AI is transforming radiology by pre-screening scans, reducing radiologists' workload by 40% while increasing anomaly detection rates. Nurses now use AI assistants like Mayo Clinic's platform that reduces medication errors by 55% through real-time cross-checking. This symbiosis creates new hybrid roles - "AI diagnosticians" who oversee multiple AI systems while focusing on complex cases, improving both job satisfaction and patient outcomes through augmented intelligence.

### 2. Case Study Critique: AI-IoT Smart Cities  
Singapore's AI-powered traffic management system demonstrates successful integration, using 1,000+ IoT sensors to predict congestion with 90% accuracy, reducing commute times by 15%. However, two critical challenges emerge: 1) Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in distributed sensor networks (a 2023 attack in Dallas disabled 150 traffic cameras), and 2) Data silos between legacy infrastructure and modern AI systems requiring costly middleware. Sustainable solutions must balance innovation with robust encryption and standardized APIs.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)

### Task 1: Edge AI Prototype (Recyclable Classifier)
```python
# TensorFlow Lite Implementation
import tensorflow as tf
from tflite_support import metadata

# Convert trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('mobilenet_recycle.h5')
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Add metadata for edge deployment
writer = metadata.MetadataWriter.create_with_metadata(
    "Recyclable Classifier v1.0",
    input_norm_mean=[127.5],
    input_norm_std=[127.5]
)
tflite_model = writer.write(tflite_model)

# Save for deployment
with open('recycle.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```
